# Simple Countdown Timer

A straightforward countdown timer application developed using MIT App Inventor. Set your desired time, start the countdown, and get notified with a sound when it finishes or is stopped.

## Overview

The Simple Countdown Timer app provides a clear interface to manage a countdown. It's useful for simple timing tasks where you need a visual countdown and an audio alert at the end.

## Features

* **Set Time:** Adjust the countdown duration using "+" and "-" buttons.
* **Start Timer:** Begin the countdown from the set value.
* **Stop Timer:** Pause or stop the countdown at any time.
* **Countdown Display:** Shows the remaining time in a text box.
* **Audio Notification:** Plays a sound when the timer reaches zero or is stopped.

## Requirements

To build and run this application, you will need:

* An account on the MIT App Inventor website (appinventor.mit.edu).
* A computer with internet access.
* An Android device or emulator for testing the application.
* A sound file (e.g., `.mp3`, `.wav`) to be played when the timer finishes or stops. Upload this file to the Media section in the Designer.

## Building the Application

Refer to the `step-to-step_guide.md` file for detailed instructions on how to recreate this application in MIT App Inventor.

## How to Use

1.  Launch the application on your Android device.
2.  Use the **+** and **-** buttons to set the desired countdown time in the text box. Each click adds or subtracts 1 unit (assuming the units are seconds based on typical timer behavior, though not explicitly defined in the blocks).
3.  Tap the **Start** button to begin the countdown.
4.  The number in the text box will decrease.
5.  Tap the **Stop** button to pause or stop the timer. A sound will play.
6.  When the countdown reaches zero, the timer will stop automatically, and a sound will play.

## Credits

This application was built using the MIT App Inventor platform (appinventor.mit.edu) and utilizes the Clock and Sound components.
